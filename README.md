<h2>Fitness classes | Do you book and go?</h2>

GoalZone is a fitness club chain in Canada and offers a range of fitness classes.

Some classes are always fully booked and often have a low attendance rate.

GoalZone wants to increase the number of spaces available for classes by predicting whether the member will attend the class or not.
